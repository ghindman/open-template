## Guidelines for publishing
•	Trademark and Branding. It needs to appear in GitHub as it would on IDZ. Including *, As the person pulling it over to IDZ, I will be held responsible, but I can’t review every document. The owners need to make sure they are following guidelines. https://legal.intel.com/trademarks
•	Images need to meet IDZ requirements. That means they should only be diagrams or screens—no stock photography or royalty free. WebOps said you can add metadata in GitHub, I am not sure how that works yet, but we just need to make sure we aren’t going to get in Legal trouble for using the images. Need signed PMRs if they are not Intel employees in images. Gavin said there aren’t a lot of images so that’s good,
•	Every time the GitHub content is updated, I need to republish the link in AEM for the updates to show up on IDZ. 
•	It would be great to get consistency to the docs.
