## Guidelines for publishing
•	Trademark and Branding. It needs to appear in GitHub as it would on IDZ. The owners need to make sure they are following guidelines. https://legal.intel.com/trademarks
•	Images need to meet IDZ requirements. That means they should only be diagrams or screens—no stock photography or royalty free. 
•	Every time the GitHub content is updated, notify IDZ publisher to republish.
